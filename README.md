<h2>The Capstone project for the Master's program at National University.</h2>

The COVID Safety Network (CSN) is a web application that compares the safety of workplaces, neighborhoods, potential homes and schools in San Diego County. 

CSN asks a user to input their zip code and major locations they visit often. A map is presented with a heatmap layer showing the exposure rates (new cases for 7 days) of nearby zip codes and a userâ€™s major locations. 

Used technologies:
- Java Script
- React JS (hooks, router)
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- Google Firebase for data storage and auth
- Heroku for hosting
